Reasoning of this lua-script: The standardfighting script is messy.
With features like ranged physical fighting, melee and upcoming magic fighting
there is a huge difference in how attacks are evaluated but only one entrypoint.
To reduce confusion it is advised to split every attack-type into its own script.
However shared functions must be accessible and not be copied.

This script is only a first step (as it contains fighting logic which it shouldnt)
Better state (imo) would be:
- standardfighting as entrypoint
- melee.lua, ranged.lua, staff.lua (spells should be handeled separatly)
- standardfighting owning all shared scripts
-- with no internal fighting-logic (like special cases for difference fightforms)
-- with smallest functions possible:
--- e.g.: checkRange checking also blocking is a confusing behavior
--- better: change function name to match behavior better
--- even better: split function into checkRange and checkBlocked (or so)
