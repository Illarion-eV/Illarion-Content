        Scaled based on users skill in relevant spell category.
        Between 3-9 "rune slots".
        Small runes use 1 "rune slot", medium runes use 1.5 "rune slots", large runes use 3 "rune slots"
        At level 0 user has 3 rune slots, at level 100 they have 9.
        EG:
        At level 0 they can cast 1 large rune or 2 medium rune or 3 small runes or a combination such as 1 medium 1 small
        At level 50 they can cast 1 large rune or 3 medium runes or 4.5 small runes or a combination.
        At level 100 they can cast 3 large, 6 medium or 9 small or a combination of the three such as 1 large, 2 medium, 3 small or 4 medium 3 small and so on

        Reducing the cost means increasing the amount of possible rune combinations.
        If our goal is to allow mages to cast more spells - increase mana regen instead.
        If our goal is to allow mages to cast more advanced spells (adding runes ontop of the biggest spells possible now ) - reduce the costs here.

        EG:
        At level 100, the cost remains at the minimum cost.
        At level 50, it would be double the cost.
        At level 0 it would be three times as much.
        So for a small rune that'd be 1111 mana at level 100 vs 2222 mana at level 50 and 3333 mana at level 0, allowing for 9 vs 4.5 vs 3 small runes in a spell.
        For medium: 1666 vs 3333 vs 5000 cost for 6 vs 3 vs 2 rune casts at level 100, 50, 0.
        For large: 3333 vs 6666 vs 9999 cost for 3 vs 1 vs 1 rune casts at level 100, 50, 0.
