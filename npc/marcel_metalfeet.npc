-- Order of triggers: Triggers are checked from top to bottom in the script. Never use very general triggers like "hi" or even ".*" on top of the script unless you know exactly what you are doing.
-- Style of triggers: Keywords are preferred. Avoid usage of phrases such as "tell me more"
-- Valid races: human, elf, dwarf, lizardman, orc, halfling
-- Valid directions: north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest
-- Appearance: If you don't change anything your NPC will wear a blue shirt, black trousers, leather glowes and leather boots at least. S/he will also have fair skin and brown hairs. Please use red-green-blue values as indicator. Ex.: colorHair = 123 (red), 62 (green), 9 (blue) = brown hair.
